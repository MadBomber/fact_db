# Abraham Lincoln's Cabinet and Administration

## Overview

Lincoln's cabinet was notable for including several of his former political rivals, leading historian Doris Kearns Goodwin to title her book about it "Team of Rivals." The cabinet members were described as "more educated, better known, and had more government experience than Lincoln himself." Initially skeptical, they eventually grew to respect his political acumen.
