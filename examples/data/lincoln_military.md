# Abraham Lincoln and Military Leadership

## Lincoln as Commander-in-Chief

Abraham Lincoln served as Commander-in-Chief of the Union armed forces throughout the Civil War (1861-1865). Historian James M. McPherson noted that "Even after Ulysses S. Grant became general-in-chief in March 1864, Lincoln maintained a significant degree of strategic oversight."

Lincoln was described as "a hands-on commander in chief who persisted through a terrible ordeal of defeats and disappointments to final triumph."

McClellan was the most popular commander of the Army of the Potomac. However, Lincoln lost confidence in him due to his reluctance to engage the enemy. After failing to pursue Confederate forces following the Battle of Antietam, Lincoln removed him from command.

The grade of Lieutenant General was revived in February 1864 specifically to allow Lincoln to promote Grant to supreme command. Unlike McClellan, Grant dutifully carried out all administration policies and understood both his mission and his relationship to civilian authority.
